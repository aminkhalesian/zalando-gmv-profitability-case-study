# Zalando GMV & Profitability Case Study

Data-driven analysis of Zalando's 2024 performance — identifying levers to improve GMV and profitability.

## Overview

This project analyzes key KPIs from Zalando's 2024 annual report and models three simple promotional scenarios (free shipping, discounts, combo) to estimate their impact on GMV, revenue and adjusted EBIT.

Main questions answered:
- Which KPIs showed the strongest / weakest growth?
- How did margin and cost structure improve?
- What are the trends in customer retention & frequency?
- How do pricing & shipping levers affect growth and profitability?
